## About

A single-page resume site built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build process or dependencies - just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Features

- **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes with system preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`) and localStorage persistence
- **Photo Gallery Easter Egg** - Click the profile photo to cycle through 18 different images
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first with tablet and desktop breakpoints
- **Scroll Animations** - Fade-in effects using Intersection Observer
- **Print Optimized** - Clean output when printing as a resume

## Built With Claude Code

This site serves as a learning project for exploring AI-assisted development. Features like dark mode, the photo cycling easter egg, and the "Click me" hint were pair-programmed with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).
